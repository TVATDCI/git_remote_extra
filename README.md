## 1. Setting Up Your Git Credentials

Before you start using Git, configure your credentials to identify yourself in commits.

1. **Set your GitHub username:**

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "YourGitHubUsername"
   ```

2. **Set your GitHub email (must match the email used for your GitHub account):**

   ```bash
   git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
   ```

3. **Ensure your default branch name is `main` (important for new repositories):**

   ```bash
   git config --global init.defaultBranch main
   ```

4. **Verify your configuration:**

   ```bash
   git config --list
   ```

   Sample output:

   ```bash
   user.name=YourGitHubUsername
   user.email=your@email.com
   init.defaultBranch=main
   ```

## 2. Generating and Adding an SSH Key to GitHub

Using SSH for authentication makes your workflow more secure and convenient.

1. **Generate an SSH key:**

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"
   ```

   - When prompted, press `Enter` to accept the default location.
   - Leave the passphrase empty for easier access.

2. **Display your SSH public key:**

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

3. **Add the SSH key to your GitHub account:**

   - Go to [GitHub SSH settings](https://github.com/settings/keys).
   - Click **"New SSH key"**.
   - Paste your key and give it a meaningful title.
   - Click **"Add SSH key"**.

4. **Test your SSH connection:**

   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

   If successful, you'll see a message like:

   ```bash
   Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
   ```

## 3. Creating a New Repository on GitHub

1. **Create a repository on GitHub:**

   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and click **"New Repository"**.
   - Choose a name, description, and visibility (public/private).
   - Click **"Create repository"**.

2. **Initialize a Git repository locally:**

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. **Add a remote repository:**

   ```bash
   git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```

4. **Add and commit files:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

5. **Push changes to GitHub:**

   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

## 4. Cloning an Existing Repository

If you want to work on an existing project, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
   git clone git@github.com:username/repository-name.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
   cd repository-name
```

---

## 5. Basic Git Workflow

1. **Check the status of your repository:**

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **Stage your changes:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Commit the changes with a message:**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Updated feature"
   ```

4. **Push your changes to GitHub:**

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

## 6. Common Git Commands

Here are some common Git commands you might find useful:

- **Check the current branch:**

  ```bash
  git branch
  ```

- **Create a new branch:**

  ```bash
  git checkout -b new-branch-name
  ```

- **Switch to an existing branch:**

  ```bash
  git checkout branch-name
  ```

- **Merge a branch into the current branch:**

  ```bash
  git merge branch-name
  ```

- **Delete a branch:**

  ```bash
  git branch -d branch-name
  ```

## 7. Resolving Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts occur when changes from different branches conflict with each other. Here's how to resolve them:

1. **Identify the files with conflicts:**

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **Open the conflicted files and manually resolve the conflicts. Look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) and edit the file to resolve the conflicts.**

3. **After resolving the conflicts, stage the resolved files:**

   ```bash
   git add resolved-file
   ```

4. **Commit the resolved changes:**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
   ```
